Migration for `Config` (`keywords_include`, `keywords_exclude`, `location`,
`cron`, `profile`, `profile_version`).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Table created, `user_id` FK present
- `keywords_include`/`keywords_exclude` stored as arrays

### ~~BE-004 · Companies schema~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.1

Migration for `Companies`, `source` as `jsonb`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Table created with documented columns
- `source` column is `jsonb`, no app-layer validation yet (that's v0.3+)

### ~~BE-005 · Jobs schema~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.1

Migration for `Jobs`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Table created with documented columns
- FK `Job.company_id -> Companies.id`

### ~~BE-006 · Runs + RunCompanyResult schema~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.1

Migration for `Runs` and `RunCompanyResult`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Both tables created
- FKs `RunCompanyResult.run_id -> Runs.id`, `.company_id -> Companies.id`

### ~~BE-007 · Scaffold Job Runner Service~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.1

FastAPI app skeleton: project layout, config loading (DB URL, secrets from
env), health-check endpoint.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `GET /health` returns 200
- Connects to Postgres on startup, fails loudly if it can't

### ~~BE-008 · Scaffold Companies Service~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.1

Same as BE-007, for the Companies Service.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `GET /health` returns 200
- Connects to Postgres on startup, fails loudly if it can't

### ~~BE-009 · Docker Compose baseline~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.1

Compose file: Postgres, Job Runner Service, Companies Service. Local `.env`
for secrets.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `docker compose up` brings up all three, health checks pass
- Services read DB URL from compose-provided env vars

### ~~BE-010 · Nginx reverse proxy~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.1

Nginx container in compose, routes by path prefix to each service.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Requests to `/companies*`, `/auth*`, `/account*` route to Companies Service
- Requests to `/config*`, `/jobs*`, `/runs*` route to Job Runner Service
- Config is TLS-ready (cert paths wired, self-signed OK locally)

### ~~PROJ-001 · CI/CD: build + deploy to droplet~~

**Target:** project **Version:** v0.1

GitHub Actions workflow: build both service images on push to `main`,
deploy to the droplet via Docker Compose.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Push to `main` produces a green deploy run
- Droplet is running the pushed commit's images after the workflow finishes

### ~~PROJ-002 · CI checks, branch rules, local hooks~~

**Target:** project **Version:** v0.1

GitHub Actions workflow on every PR and push to `main`, plus rules on
`main` so nothing merges red. Same checks run locally via pre-commit and
Claude Code hooks.

- **CI jobs:** Ruff lint + format check, `uv lock --check`, pytest against a
  Postgres service container, migration round-trip (`upgrade head` →
  `downgrade base` → `upgrade head`) with a single-head check, `docker build`
  (no push)
- **Branch rules on `main`:** PR required, CI required to pass, no force
  push, no direct push. Private repo: rulesets/branch protection need
  **GitHub Pro** (or Team) — upgrade, or record that they are convention only
- **pre-commit:** Ruff, `uv lock --check`, gitleaks (from PROJ-003); a
  `make hooks` target that installs them
- **Claude Code hooks** in committed `.claude/settings.json`: run Ruff on
  edited Python files, deny edits to `.env*`
- **PR hygiene:** PR template (`Closes #`, test checklist), check that the PR
  title starts with a ticket ID (`BE-`/`FE-`/`PROJ-`)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A PR with a lint error, failing test, broken migration or two Alembic heads
  shows a red check and can't be merged
- `make hooks` installs pre-commit; a commit with a Ruff error is blocked
- CI runtime stays under ~5 minutes

### ~~PROJ-003 · Secret, dependency and image scanning~~

**Target:** project **Version:** v0.1

Security scans that work on a **private** repo without GitHub Advanced
Security (so no GitHub secret scanning / CodeQL).

- **Secrets:** gitleaks in CI (full history on first run) and in pre-commit
- **Dependencies:** Dependabot version updates (uv/pip, Docker, GitHub
  Actions) + Dependabot alerts; `pip-audit` in CI
- **Code:** Ruff `S` (Bandit) rules enabled, false positives ignored inline
  with a reason
- **Images:** Trivy scan of both service images in the PROJ-001 workflow,
  failing on HIGH/CRITICAL with a fix available

**Depends on:** PROJ-001 (Trivy step), PROJ-002 (CI workflow, pre-commit).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A committed fake secret fails CI and is blocked by pre-commit
- Dependabot opens update PRs weekly, grouped to avoid noise
- A known-vulnerable dependency or image layer fails the check

---

## v0.2 — Auth & account basics

### ~~BE-011 · POST /auth/signup (email+password)~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.2

Hash + store password, create `Users` row.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Duplicate email returns a clear 409
- Password stored as a hash, never plaintext

### ~~BE-012 · POST /auth/login + JWT issuing~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.2

Verify credentials, issue a signed JWT carrying `user_id`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Wrong password/unknown email returns 401, no user enumeration in the message
- Token verifiable with the shared signing secret

### ~~BE-013 · POST /auth/google~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.2

Verify the Google ID token the frontend posts (from Google Identity
Services), find-or-create `Users` row by `google_id`, issue JWT.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- First-time Google login creates a `Users` row with `password_hash: null`
- Repeat login matches the existing row, doesn't duplicate

### ~~BE-014 · Shared JWT validation middleware~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.2

Middleware/dependency, used by both services, validating the JWT locally
against the shared signing secret and injecting `user_id`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Missing/invalid/expired token returns 401 on any protected route
- Valid token makes `user_id` available to route handlers in both services

### ~~BE-015 · GET/PUT /account~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.2

Fetch and update own credentials (email, password).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `PUT` requires current password to change it
- Response never includes `password_hash`

### ~~FE-001 · Sign up page~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.2

Email/password form + "Sign up with Google" button.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Successful signup redirects into the app, authenticated
- Server validation errors (e.g. duplicate email) surface inline

### ~~FE-002 · Log in page~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.2

Email/password form + Google login button.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Successful login redirects into the app, authenticated
- Invalid credentials show an inline error

### ~~FE-003 · Session handling~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.2

Store the JWT, attach it to API calls to both services, protect
authenticated routes, redirect to login when missing/expired.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Refreshing the page keeps the session until the token expires
- An expired/invalid token redirects to login instead of showing broken data

### ~~PROJ-004 · Type checking, SAST and quality dashboard~~

**Target:** project **Version:** v0.2

Deeper checks, timed for the auth work (first real logic and first
security-sensitive code).

- **Types:** mypy or pyright in "basic" mode in CI and pre-commit; tighten
  per module later
- **SAST:** Semgrep (Python + FastAPI rules) in CI — CodeQL needs GitHub
  Advanced Security on a private repo
- **Coverage:** pytest-cov in CI, reported on the PR; minimum threshold set
  once v0.2 lands
- **Quality dashboard:** pick one of Codacy / SonarQube Cloud / Codecov (or
  none) — check free-tier limits for private repos before choosing

**Depends on:** PROJ-002.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Type and Semgrep checks are required on `main` and green on the current code
- Coverage percentage visible on every PR
- Dashboard decision recorded here (tool chosen or explicitly skipped)

**Decisions:**

- **Types:** mypy (pure Python, runs from the project venv in CI and
  pre-commit), default mode plus `check_untyped_defs`.
- **SAST:** Semgrep `p/python` + `p/fastapi`, run with pinned `uvx`.
- **Coverage:** pytest-cov with `fail_under = 90` (96% when set). Shown as a
  PR comment and in the `test` job summary.
- **Dashboard: skipped.** The PR coverage comment plus the CI checks cover
  what we need now, with no third-party service or extra secret. Revisit
  if we want coverage trends over time.

### v0.2 follow-ups

BE-011 – BE-015 are merged. Still to do:

- **Open questions:** see SYSTEM_DESIGN.md → Auth & accounts → Open
  questions. Update the code and that section once each is decided.
- ~~**`.env.example`:** add `JWT_SECRET` (required) and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
  (optional), matching the README env block.~~ Done.
- ~~**Running tests locally:** use `make test`. Plain `uv run pytest` doesn't
  load `.env`, so every DB test is skipped and the run still looks green.~~ Done: `make test` exists and README documents it.
- ~~**CORS (blocks the deployed frontend):** neither service adds CORS
  headers, and neither does Nginx. Browser calls from the Vercel origin fail
  their preflight check, including FE-001 and FE-002 signup and login. Add
  `CORSMiddleware` in the shared `create_app`. Read allowed origins from an
  env var (e.g. `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`), and allow the `Authorization` and
  `Content-Type` headers. Document the env var in `.env.example` and DEPLOY.md.~~ Done in #88 / #91.

---

## v0.3 — Manual company management

### ~~BE-016 · GET /companies~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.3

List the authenticated user's companies.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Only returns rows for the requesting `user_id`

### ~~BE-017 · POST /companies (manual)~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.3

Create a company with an explicit `source` (`board` or `scraper` kind only),
no detection.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Rejects a malformed `source` (wrong discriminant/missing fields) with 400
- `custom` kind rejected for now (v0.10)

### ~~BE-018 · PUT /companies/{id}~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.3

Edit an existing company (name, tier, source, active).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- 404 if the company doesn't belong to the requesting user
- Partial updates supported (e.g. tier-only change)

### ~~FE-004 · Companies list screen~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.3

Table/list of tracked companies: name, tier, board/source kind, added date,
active state.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Empty state shown when no companies exist yet

### ~~FE-005 · Manual add-company form~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.3

Form to add a company with an explicit source (board picker + board_id, or
scraper strategy + selectors).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Submitting calls `POST /companies` and the new row appears in the list

### ~~FE-006 · Edit company dialog~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.3

Edit name/tier/source from the list.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Changing tier shows the "re-groups jobs" note from the mockup

### ~~FE-007 · Pause/remove company actions~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.3

Row menu actions: pause (`active = false`) and remove.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Pausing doesn't delete the row or its jobs
- Removing asks for confirmation before calling the API

---

## v0.4 — Runner pipeline (manual trigger)

### ~~BE-019 · Run lifecycle + advisory lock scaffolding~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

Acquire `pg_try_advisory_lock`, open a `Runs` row (`status: running`), close
it `success`/`failed` when the pipeline finishes or throws.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Lock held for the run's duration, released in a `finally`
- A run that throws mid-pipeline still closes the `Runs` row as `failed`

### ~~BE-020 · Fetch openings — board source~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

Fetch current openings from a company's board API (Greenhouse/Lever/
Ashby/SmartRecruiters).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Returns a normalized list (title, url, location) per board type
- Non-200/malformed response is treated as a fetch failure, not empty

### ~~BE-021 · Fetch openings — scraper source~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

Fetch current openings via CSS-selector scraping (static + dynamic/
Playwright strategies).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Selectors from `Source.selectors` are used, not hardcoded
- Selector/network failure is a fetch failure, not an empty result

### ~~BE-022 · Diff by URL + write new Jobs~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

Compare fetched openings against stored `Jobs` by URL, insert new ones.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Existing URLs are never re-inserted or duplicated
- New rows get `match_score`/`match_description` left unset (v0.5 fills them)

### ~~BE-023 · Close disappeared jobs~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

Per company whose fetch succeeded, set `active = false` on stored jobs no
longer in current openings — success test differs by `source.kind` per the
table in SYSTEM_DESIGN.md.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `board` kind: runs on any HTTP success, including empty `[]`
- `scraper` kind: only runs on a non-empty result
- A failed fetch never closes any jobs for that company

### ~~BE-024 · Write RunCompanyResult~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

One row per company per run recording `status`/`jobs_found`/`error`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Every company in the run gets exactly one row, regardless of outcome

### ~~BE-025 · POST /runs (manual trigger)~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

Wires BE-019 through BE-024 into one endpoint.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Calling it while a run is already in flight no-ops (lock contention)
- Returns the created `Runs` row (at least its id/status)

### ~~BE-026 · GET /jobs~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

List jobs with filters: active, company, tier.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Only returns rows for the requesting `user_id`
- Filters are combinable (e.g. active + tier)

### ~~FE-008 · Jobs board screen~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.4

List view with active/company/tier filters.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Empty state when no jobs match the current filters
- Manual "run now" action calls `POST /runs`

### v0.4 follow-ups

BE-019 – BE-026 are merged. Found while building them:

### ~~PROJ-009 · Chromium in the Docker image for dynamic scrapes~~

**Target:** project **Version:** v0.4

The image has the `playwright` package but no browser, so every `scraper`
source with `strategy: "dynamic"` fails in production. It fails safe: the
company's `RunCompanyResult` is `failed` and no jobs are closed. Install
Chromium (`playwright install --with-deps chromium`) where the non-root
`app` user can read it.

Since v0.8 it also breaks detection: `POST /companies/detect` can't use its
browser fallback, so JS-rendered careers pages come back `needs_custom` and
pages that block a plain GET come back 422.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A `dynamic` scraper source fetches successfully in the deployed container
- The image still passes the Trivy HIGH/CRITICAL gate

### ~~BE-045 · POST /runs can outlive the Nginx proxy timeout~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

`POST /runs` runs the pipeline inside the request, and Nginx's default
`proxy_read_timeout` (60s) applies to `/runs`. Many companies or slow
`dynamic` scrapes (up to ~40s each) can exceed it: the client gets a 504
while the run continues. Preferred fix: return 202 with the `running` row
and run the pipeline in a background task (BE-019's lifecycle already
allows it).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A run longer than the proxy timeout still gives the client a usable response
- Lock contention still no-ops (409); a failing run still closes as `failed`

### ~~BE-046 · Paginate GET /jobs~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.4

Jobs are never deleted, so `GET /jobs` grows without bound.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Bounded `limit` plus `offset` or a `(date, id)` keyset cursor
- Works with the existing `active` / `company_id` / `tier` filters
- Response tells the client whether more rows exist (coordinate with FE-008)

---

## v0.5 — Match scoring

### ~~BE-027 · Config.profile + GET/PUT /config~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.5

Add `profile`/`profile_version` to `Config`, expose read/write.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `profile_version` increments on every `profile` change
- No history of past profile text is kept, per design

### ~~BE-028 · Match-scoring agent~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.5

Pipeline step 6: score each new job against `Config.profile`, write
`match_score`/`match_description`/`profile_version`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Every job written by BE-022 in this run gets a score before step 7 commits
- `Job.profile_version` matches the `Config.profile_version` used to score it

### ~~FE-009 · Settings → Profile tab~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.5

Edit the markdown profile text.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Saving shows the "applies to next run, already-scored jobs keep their
  score" note from the mockup

---

## v0.6 — Notifications

### ~~BE-029 · Transactional email client~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.6

Thin wrapper around the chosen provider (Resend/Postmark/SES).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Send succeeds/fails distinguishably (caller can tell if it must not stamp
  `notified_at`)

### ~~BE-030 · Digest send + notified_at stamping~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.6

Pipeline step 8: send every job where `active = true AND notified_at IS
NULL`; stamp `notified_at` only after provider confirms success.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Empty digest set sends no email
- A failed send leaves `notified_at` null so those jobs reappear next digest

### ~~FE-010 · Settings → Notifications tab~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.6

Notification preferences screen — no Notion-mirror toggle (retired).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Matches the mockup minus the stale Notion control

---

## v0.7 — Scheduling

### ~~BE-031 · Internal tick loop~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.7

Background loop, wakes every minute, reads `Config.cron`, checks it against
the last `Runs.started_at` to decide if a run is due.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Changing `Config.cron` changes behavior on the next tick, no restart needed

### ~~BE-032 · Wire advisory lock into scheduled runs~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.7

Due ticks call the same run pipeline as manual `POST /runs`, sharing the
BE-019 lock so they can't overlap.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A due tick during an in-flight manual run no-ops instead of double-running

### ~~FE-011 · Settings → Schedule tab~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.7

Cron editor (including raw cron override per the mockup).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Saving calls `PUT /config`, next-run estimate updates accordingly

---

## v0.8 — Agent-assisted onboarding

### ~~BE-033 · Deterministic ATS signature matcher~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

Match a pasted careers URL/host against known signatures for Greenhouse,
Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A known-board URL resolves to `{kind: "board", board, board_id}` with no
  LLM call
- Unrecognized URL returns no match, doesn't throw

### ~~BE-034 · LLM selector-discovery fallback~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

When BE-033 finds no match, an agent reads the page and proposes
`Selectors`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Returns a draft `Selectors` object when the agent finds a plausible list
- Returns "needs custom handling" when it can't (feeds v0.10's paused state)

### ~~BE-035 · POST /companies/detect~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

Wires BE-033 → BE-034, verifies with a live fetch, returns a draft `Source`
plus a scored sample of matched openings.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Response sample jobs are scored using the existing v0.5 scoring path
- Confirming persists exactly the returned `Source`, no re-detection

### ~~BE-036 · POST /companies/{id}/test~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

Re-run a company's existing source, report reachability/job count.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Reports failure distinctly from "reachable, zero jobs"

### ~~FE-012 · Add-company: paste URL + resolving state~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.8

Paste-a-URL input, "agent resolving: Detected Greenhouse..." loading state.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Matches the mockup's resolving copy/behavior

### ~~FE-013 · Add-company: confirm + added banner~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.8

Confirm screen showing the scored sample; on confirm, success banner.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Confirm calls the persist step and the company appears in FE-004's list

### v0.8 follow-ups

Found while building BE-033 – BE-036 (#106, #107). The dynamic fallback
also needs PROJ-009 (Chromium in the image).

### ~~BE-048 · POST /companies/detect can outlive the Nginx proxy timeout~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

Detect runs inside the request. Worst case: a static GET, an LLM call on
~60k chars, a browser render, a second LLM call, then scoring 5 jobs. Each
OpenAI call can take up to 60s, and `nginx/` sets no `proxy_read_timeout`
(60s default). The client then gets a 504 instead of `DetectOut`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A slow detect still gives the client a usable response (e.g. a total time
  budget inside the request, or 202 + poll like BE-045)
- The add-company flow (FE-012) still shows the resolving state

### BE-053 · Let slow selector discovery finish instead of timing out

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

BE-048's 50s budget fits under Nginx's 60s default, but discovery's worst
case is far longer (two LLM calls of up to 60s each, plus a 40s render).
A slow page that would have worked comes back `needs_custom` with
"detection took too long". Also, work already running in a thread (fetch,
render) isn't cancelled when the budget runs out.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Decide from real timings whether the budget is too tight (e.g. log how
  long detects take and how often they time out)
- If it is: raise `proxy_read_timeout` for `/companies/detect` only, raise
  `DETECT_BUDGET_SECONDS` to stay under it, and check the frontend's own
  request timeout allows it

### ~~BE-049 · Rate-limit POST /companies/detect~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

Signup is open, and one detect request can mean a headless render, 2
selector-discovery calls and 5 scoring calls. Nothing bounds how often a
user can call it.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Per-user limit on detect calls (e.g. N per hour); over it returns 429
- The limit is set from an env var with a sane default
- No Redis or other new service (see CLAUDE.md out-of-scope list)

### ~~BE-050 · Detect boards embedded on a company's own careers page~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

`match_board` only checks the pasted URL. A page like `acme.com/careers`
that embeds Greenhouse, Lever or Ashby (script tag or iframe) isn't matched.
`clean_html` also strips that script/iframe, so the LLM can't see it either.
This is probably the most common thing users paste.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A careers page embedding a known board's widget resolves to a `board`
  source, with no LLM call
- Embed detection reads the fetched HTML (script `src`, iframe `src`,
  links); only known board hosts count

### ~~BE-051 · Wait for client-rendered job lists in selector discovery~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

`render_page` without `wait_for` returns the HTML at the `load` event.
Single-page apps that fetch jobs after load look empty, so discovery comes
back `needs_custom`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Discovery's render waits for the page to settle (e.g. network idle,
  bounded by the existing render timeout)
- Scheduled `dynamic` scrapes keep waiting on `selectors.job` as today

### ~~BE-052 · Support EU-hosted Greenhouse and Lever boards~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.8

`*.eu.greenhouse.io` and `jobs.eu.lever.co` use other API hosts than the
board fetchers call, so BE-033 doesn't match them. They fall through to
selector discovery.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- EU board URLs resolve to a `board` source and fetch from the right API host
- The stored `Source` records the region (schema change agreed in
  SYSTEM_DESIGN.md first)

---

## v0.9 — Runs visibility

### ~~BE-037 · GET /runs~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.9

Run history for the dashboard.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Ordered most-recent first
- Only returns the requesting user's runs

### ~~BE-038 · GET /runs/{id}/companies~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.9

Per-company breakdown for one run, from `RunCompanyResult`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- 404 if the run doesn't belong to the requesting user

### ~~FE-014 · Runs screen~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.9

Next run estimate, today's totals, run history, per-company breakdown.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Per-company rows show ok/failed/skipped and job counts per the mockup

---

## v0.10 — Custom handler escape hatch

### ~~BE-039 · Source.kind: "custom" support~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.10

Extend the `Source` union/validation to accept `{kind: "custom", handler}`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `POST`/`PUT /companies` accept a `custom` source (previously rejected in
  BE-017)

### ~~BE-040 · Pipeline support for custom handlers~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.10

Steps 2/5 dispatch to a per-company handler function keyed by
`source.handler`; handler self-reports success/failure.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A company with no implemented handler is treated as failed/skipped, not
  a crash
- Handler's own success/failure feeds `RunCompanyResult` and the step-5
  close-disappeared-jobs decision

### ~~FE-015 · "Needs custom handling" paused state~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v0.10

Visual state on a company row when detection fell through to `custom` with
no handler yet.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Row shows a distinct "needs custom handling" badge, stays paused until a
  developer ships the handler

---

## v0.11 — Account completeness

### ~~BE-041 · POST /auth/password-reset/request~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.11

Issue a `PasswordResetToken`, email the reset link.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Unknown email still returns a generic success response (no enumeration)
- Token stored hashed, never the raw value

### ~~BE-042 · POST /auth/password-reset/confirm~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v0.11

Verify token, set new password, mark token used.

**Acceptance criteria:**

## v1.0 — Cutover

### ~~PROJ-011 · Reload the compose Nginx after each deploy~~

**Target:** project **Version:** v1.0

The compose Nginx resolves `job-runner` and `companies` to IPs once, at
start. Deploys recreate both app containers but leave Nginx running, so it
proxied to stale IPs and every route returned FastAPI's 404. Edits to
`nginx/default.conf` also never took effect on deploy.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `deploy.sh` reloads the compose Nginx after `compose up`
- After a deploy, `GET /jobs` without a token returns 401, not 404

### ~~PROJ-013 · /ticket skill: ticket to PR in one command~~

**Target:** project **Version:** v1.0

Every ticket ran the same manual loop: fetch `main`, branch, implement,
update docs, run checks, push, open the PR.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `.claude/skills/ticket/SKILL.md` runs that loop, user-invoked only
- `/ticket <ID>` and `/ticket #<issue>` both resolve to the same ticket
  and issue
- CLAUDE.md's ticket workflow mentions `/ticket`

### PROJ-005 · One-time company import script

**Target:** project **Version:** v1.0

Script importing `config.yaml`'s ~40 companies into `Companies`/`Source`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Every company in `config.yaml` gets a row with a correctly-typed `source`
- `type: smartrecruiters` and the ATS `type`s map to `board`; the rest
  (`google`, `deel`, `ebay`, `kleinanzeigen`, `aiven`, `bolt`, `betterstack`,
  and the `dynamic` entries) map to `custom` or `scraper` per their current
  `main.py`/`ats_api.py` handling

### PROJ-006 · Retire script-run CI workflows

**Target:** project **Version:** v1.0

Confirm `daily.yml`/`full-scan.yml` are fully retargeted to build/deploy
(from PROJ-001) and no longer invoke `main.py` directly.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- No workflow step runs the old script

### PROJ-007 · Decommission Gmail SMTP + Notion

**Target:** project **Version:** v1.0

Remove `notify/notion.py` and SMTP-based email code/config/secrets from the
old script's path.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- No remaining code path sends via Gmail SMTP or writes to Notion
- Old secrets (Gmail app password, Notion token) revoked/removed from repo
  and droplet

### PROJ-008 · Go-live checklist

**Target:** project **Version:** v1.0

Final cutover: confirm all v0.x tickets closed, run PROJ-005, disable the
old script's trigger, monitor first live scheduled run end-to-end.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- First post-cutover digest arrives from the new system, not the old script
- Old script's GitHub Actions trigger is disabled (not just unused)

### ~~PROJ-012 · Agent skills setup, domain glossary and v1.1 planning docs~~

**Target:** project **Version:** v1.0

Agent-skills config (`docs/agents/`), `CONTEXT.md` glossary, ADR 0001, and
the tickets from spec #126 mirrored here. Issue: #132.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Files on `main`; this file and `VERSIONING.md` match the published issues

### ~~BE-054 · Pausing a company leaves its jobs alone~~

**Target:** backend **Version:** v1.0

Pausing a Company stops it being fetched but leaves its Jobs as they were.
Resuming changes no Job either. Paused companies' Jobs are left out of the
Digest. `GET /jobs` items gain `company_active`. Spec: #126. Issue: #127.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Pause/resume change no Job
- Digest = open, unsent Jobs whose Company isn't paused
- `GET /jobs` items include `company_active: bool`

### BE-055 · Run breakdown keeps the company name it ran with

**Target:** backend **Version:** v1.0

`RunCompanyResult` stores the Company name at run time; `company_id` becomes
nullable (`ON DELETE SET NULL`). Groundwork for BE-056. Issue: #128.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Existing rows backfilled with the current name
- `/runs/{id}/companies` shows the current name, or the stored one with
  `company_id: null` once the Company is gone

### BE-056 · Delete a company

**Target:** backend **Version:** v1.0

`DELETE /companies/{id}` removes the Company and its Jobs, keeps run history
(ADR 0001). Blocked by BE-055. Issue: #129.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `204` / `404` (missing or another user's) / `409` while a run holds the lock
- Jobs deleted; `Runs` and breakdown rows kept with the stored name
- Re-adding the same Company stores its postings as new Jobs

### ~~FE-019 · Job list follows the cursor~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v1.0

Page through all Jobs with `X-Next-Cursor` ("Load more" or infinite scroll).
Issue: job-lighthouse-frontend#43.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] Next page requested with the cursor until the header is absent
- [x] No "Load more" or extra requests once the header is absent
- [x] Changing filters resets the list (filters are client-side, so the loaded
      pages and cursor stay valid; nothing to refetch)
- [x] No duplicate or skipped Jobs when a Run adds Jobs between page loads
      (server keyset cursor; client drops repeated ids; a finished Run restarts
      from the first page)

### ~~FE-020 · Delete company action and paused badge on jobs~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v1.0

Delete a Company from its row menu (confirm, 409 retry message); mark Jobs of
Paused companies via `company_active`. Blocked by BE-054, BE-056. Issue:
job-lighthouse-frontend#44.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] "Remove company" in the row menu calls `DELETE /companies/{id}` after a
      confirm dialog saying its Jobs will be deleted
- [x] **204**: the Company leaves the list; the job list loads fresh on its next
      visit, so its Jobs are gone
- [x] **409** "A run is in progress": the message is shown, the dialog stays
      open and the user can retry
- [x] **404**: the dialog closes and the list is refreshed
- [x] Jobs with `company_active: false` show a "Paused" badge
- [x] Pause/resume copy no longer says Jobs are closed (no UI copy did; the
      stale comments and SYSTEM_DESIGN.md text were fixed)

---

## v1.1 — Company and run controls

### BE-057 · Total job count on the first page of GET /jobs

**Target:** backend **Version:** v1.1

`X-Total-Count` header on `GET /jobs` without a cursor, respecting filters,
exposed via CORS. Issue: #130.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Count matches the filters; header absent on cursor pages
- Header in CORS `expose_headers`

### BE-058 · Single-company run

**Target:** backend **Version:** v1.1

`POST /runs` with optional `{ company_id }`. `Runs` gains `scope` and
`company_id`; the scheduler counts only Full runs. Blocked by BE-056.
Issue: #131.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `404` (missing or another user's) / `409` paused / `409` run in progress
- One Company fetched, one `RunCompanyResult`, normal Digest sent
- A recent Single-company run doesn't make a Full run "not due"
- `GET /runs` returns `scope` and `company_id`

### ~~FE-021 · Show the job total~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v1.1

Show "N of total" from the first page's `X-Total-Count`. Blocked by BE-057,
FE-019. Issue: job-lighthouse-frontend#45.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] The total is read from the first page's `X-Total-Count` and shown next
      to the list ("N of total jobs", N = jobs loaded so far)
- [x] Total kept across "Load more", refreshed on filter change (filters are
      client-side, so it only changes when a finished Run restarts from the
      first page)
- [x] Nothing breaks if the header is missing (no total shown)

### ~~FE-022 · Run this company button and scope in run history~~

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v1.1

"Run now" per active Company; run history marks Single-company runs with the
Company name. Blocked by BE-058. Issue: job-lighthouse-frontend#46.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] "Run now" in the companies row menu (active Companies only) calls
      `POST /runs` with `{ company_id }`
- [x] 404 / 409 (paused, run in progress) messages shown
- [x] Run history marks Single-company runs and names the Company from the
      breakdown row (`RunCompanyResult.company_name`)
- [x] Single-company runs shown for Deleted companies, using the stored name

### FE-023 · Settings → Filters tab

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v1.1

Edit `keywords_include`, `keywords_exclude` and `location` in Settings,

default when `?tab=` is missing. Issue: job-lighthouse-frontend#54.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] Keywords to include and to exclude edited as comma-separated lists
- [x] Hint that excludes match whole words only
- [x] Location field
- [x] Saving calls `PUT /config` with every editable field and shows the
      "applies to the next run" note

### FE-024 · UI polish and faster navigation

**Target:** frontend **Version:** v1.1

Small fixes from a click-through review, plus a faster feel when switching
screens. Issue: job-lighthouse-frontend#55.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [x] Run banners can be closed; "Run started" clears when the run ends,
      "Run finished" after a few seconds, failures stay until closed
- [x] A paused company's row menu popover is fully opaque
- [x] The company name links to its website in a new tab
- [x] Clicking anywhere on a Runs history row selects that run
- [x] Jobs has a Refresh button that reloads from the first page
- [x] Screens show a loading skeleton at once on navigation
- [x] The header no longer refetches the job list on every navigation
